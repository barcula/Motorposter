# conceptual formulation

Our task was to create a motorized Poster or Object witch interacts with the viewer. It has to be created in this way, that there isnÂ´t an active input needed from the person who stands in front of it.
it need to be more like something witch is triggered unconsciously and surprises the viewer. 

# development of concept

I wanted to keep it simple but it still have to confuse the viewer. How is that working? After brainstorming i came to the point that it should be something with an optical illusion. After a long research i was really happy to find the morales effect which makes a big smile on my face. That was exactly what i was looking for.
